Data Set in general

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The dataset contains so-called listings which either have been transformed to a loan or not. Partially funded loans are possible as well. My main overall interest might be why and who is becoming a so-called Prosper borrower and furthermore what is mainly influencing the interest rate. Interesting would be how the average Prosper rate is compared to the normal financial market.
